# Health Insurance Claim Project

## Business Problem:

“Finding out the health parameters that affect health insurance claims”
An insurance company in the US is reviewing its insurance claims/charges and is trying to do a cause-and-effect analysis for future business decisions. It has collected data for its customers who have made claims in recent times. The data points collected are age, gender, BMI, number of children/dependents, smoking habit, the region they belong to, and charges/bills claimed under the insurance. This analysis would have a bearing on what premium should the company charge a customer availing an insurance policy.
